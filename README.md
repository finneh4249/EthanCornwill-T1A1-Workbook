## Q2: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet

- Packets
- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Routers and routing
- Domains and DNS

> Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

### Packets

These are little bits of data that are sent across a network. Packets are vital for the internet because they allow huge messages to be broken down and transported over several different paths before being reassembled.

Packetization enables more efficient and reliable data transfer. If a single lane becomes overloaded or fails, packets can be diverted to alternate paths, ensuring that the data reaches its destination. This method also enables several data transfers to occur concurrently over the same network infrastructure, which is a crucial feature of the internet's resiliency and scalability.

### IP Addresses

IP addresses are unique identities for all devices on the internet. Originally, we had IPv4, which had 32-bits. Unfortunately, the address space was limited by its 32-bit structure and as a result, IPv6 was created this has 128 bits. The creation of IPv6 has significantly boosted the number of addresses that can be created while improving routing and security.

An example of an IPv4 address is '192.168.1.1'. This format, known as dotted decimal, consists of four octets with values ranging from 0 to 255, providing for a huge but finite number of unique addresses. In contrast, '2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334' is an example of an IPv6 address. IPv6 addresses are encoded as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, significantly increasing the address space to handle the expanding number of internet-connected devices. The shift from IPv4 to IPv6 is ongoing.

### Routers and routing

Routers are devices that direct data packets along the best paths to their destinations using routing tables. Routing is the process that determines these paths, which can be static or dynamic, with dynamic routing allowing for more efficient data transfer across complex networks.

### Domains and DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that converts domain names, such as google.com, into IP addresses. This is essential for locating various gadgets over the internet. When you enter a domain name, the DNS resolver starts the process by contacting the root nameserver. The root points it to the TLD nameserver that corresponds to the domain extension, such as.com or.org. This TLD nameserver then directs the resolver to the domain's authoritative nameserver, which contains the actual IP address of the server that hosts the website. With this IP address, your browser may connect to the website's server and load it for you. This sophisticated technology offers a smooth internet experience by streamlining the process of accessing websites.
